PYINSIM

pyinsim is a InSim module for the Python programming language. It creates 
socket connection with LFS and provides many classes, functions and 
enumerations for sending and receiving data between your program and the game.

REQUIREMENTS

The module requires Python 2.7 or better to run. Note: It does not currently 
support Python 3.0. You can download Python from the following URL:

http://www.python.org/download/

INSTALLATION

To install pyinsim on Windows, simply unzip the package and run the windows
installer 'pyinsim-x.x.x.win32.exe'. 

To install from the source distribution, unzip the package and run the command 
'python setup.py install'. 

Both of these methods will install pyinsim to your 
'X:\Path\To\Python\Lib\site-packages' directory. 

Of course you always have the option of just copying the package folder into 
your program's source directory (this is also useful for when you redistribute
your program.).
